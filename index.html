                    </div> 
                    <p>&emsp;I am Maveli, the asura king of Kerala. I am a benevolent and just ruler who cares for my subjects greatly. I am also a devotee of Vishnu, the supreme god in Hinduism.</p><br>
                    <p>&emsp;I am renowned as the founder of the Chera dynasty and the erstwhile ruler of Kerala, a period often referred to as the 'Golden Age' in the history of Kerala. I governed without discrimination based on wealth, caste, or religion. As a king, I was a trusted friend and protector of my subjects. I promoted prosperity and harmony among my people. The festival of Onam, celebrated by the people of Kerala, is a significant part of my legacy, symbolizing their rich cultural heritage and fond remembrance of my rule</p><br>
                    <p>&emsp;I was a king who really loved my people in my country. It was very hard for me to send them to a place called the netherworld, and it made me sad. So, I asked Lord Mahavishnu if I could visit my people once a year, and he said yes. That's why every year, I come back to Kerala to see my dear people, and I care about them a lot. I'm always happy to be with them, even if it's just for a little while each year."</p><br>

                    <div class="s-left">
                        <p>The great-grandson of asura Hiranyakashipu, Maveli was just and generous, and a deeply loved leader. In the first myth, Maveli’s renown and invincibility made the gods jealous, who then hatched a plan to defeat the asuras. They requested Maveli to help them retrieve Indra’s treasure from the celestial ocean that it had fallen into, all the while trying to create the nectar of immortality to defeat the asuras in war. Only Maveli was skilled enough to churn the entire ocean, and in a bid to achieve peace between the two clans, he agreed.The trickery of the gods was soon revealed, and a war broke out between the gods and asuras – which the asuras won. The story goes that this ushered in an era of peace in the land, remembered in Bahujan folk memory as one marked by equality between people, and no discrimination or malfeasance of any kind. This was Mavelinadu, the land of Maveli. He was of the land and he honoured it, honoured its people and rejected the varnashrama dharma.<br>
                        In brahmanic tellings of the tale, the rule of asuras is depicted as a dark and evil time, one that outright rejects vedic and brahmanical teachings. As Mahabali grew stronger and more popular, the gods created yet another plan to unseat him. They sent Vishnu in the form of Vamana, a brahmin who asked Bali for a piece of land the size of three paces. Mahabali was renowned for his generosity, and granted the wish immediately, thinking it a very humble request. But immediately, Vamana grew to “cosmic size”, and placed one foot on the earth and the other on the sky. Not one to go back on his word, Bali accepted defeat and Vamana placed his foot on his head, pushing Bali into the underworld along with the other asuras
                        <span id="dots">...</span><span  id="more"><br>The people of Kerala rejected Vamana, and pleaded to their ruler to visit them every year. The return of Maveli to his land every year is Thiruvonam or Onam, a harvest festival celebrated in remembrance of an egalitarian past, and dream of a similar future.
                        Myths need to be understood in their context, and are often a reflection of their time – especially in the way they are framed, and how certain groups become antagonists in stories. These myths become propaganda pushed onto people by those trying to establish a hegemony. The victory of Vamana over Maveli signals the arrival of brahmanism and varnashrama in Kerala, and its subsequent erasure of a shramanic past. 
                        It was a man named Sahodaran Ayyappan - a disciple of Narayana Guru, an Ezhava poet and anti-caste activist, who revived the story of Maveli in Kerala. He penned a version of the Onapaattu (song of Onam) that is a critique of the brahmanism that has burgeoned in Kerala since the 8th century CE. He calls for a return to the time of Mavelinadu, before the feudal Hindu system infiltrated the land and created notions of purity and pollution.<br>
                        To people belonging to marginalised castes in Kerala, especially avarna people, Mahabali remains a symbol of a past that was untainted by the disease of brahmanism. There have been a number of attempts to sanitise this story of its revolutionary importance, and to appropriate Onam into a Hindu festival, even rebrand it as “Vamana Jayanti”. This is an insult to the cultural legacy of Maveli, and we must reclaim this story, passed on to us through generations of oral tradition. We assert that Maveli is a symbol of our historical struggle against caste, and an egalitarian shramana tradition that lingers in our memory.</span>
